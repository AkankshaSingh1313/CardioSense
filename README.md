# CardioSense

The CVDs have remained continuously the leading cause of death worldwide, with about 17.9 million deaths annually. The diseases are supposed to be diagnosed early enough for timely intervention in order to reduce morbidity and mortality arising from heart diseases. However, the diagnosis through the identification of underlying risks is usually done using rather sophisticated tools due to the sophistication inherent in most cardiovascular conditions. In this scenario, CardioSense can be thought of as a bright solution that uses cloud computing and explainable AI in order to enable a progressive, scalable, and interpretable method of heart disease detection. 

CardioSense is a cloud-based analytics platform that takes inputs from the patient's past medical history, his lifestyle, and clinical parameters to predict the possibility of heart disease. It is the aspiration of CardioSense to provide an accuracy as high as possible but also give insight into how those AI models make their decisions in a way that is as transparent as possible, using machine learning models enhanced with explainable AI techniques. That is important in instilling confidence among health professionals and patients through the provision of understandable and actionable recommendations made by AI. It will be integrated with cloud computing to let the CardioSense app provide seamless access to both health professionals and patients for immediate analysis and monitoring from any location. The integration of high-level AI technologies into practical healthcare can further empower such cooperation to support the enhancement of early detection and management capabilities of cardiac ailments, creating a better outlook for the patient.
